This is useful for functions like load and check whose job is not to change the elements in the WORD array, but only to read them. Other pointers, however, can change the value of the chars stored in the WORD array, allowing MAIN to pass a new string to the CHECK function, while taking extra steps to ensure that CHECK does not modify it.he parameters for check and load are constants because we mustn't change the values standing behind them.
